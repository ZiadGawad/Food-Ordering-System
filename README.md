# Food Ordering Management System

A personal project built to practice OOP principles, problem-solving, and basic software engineering concepts using a real-world food ordering scenario

## Overview
This project simulates a simple food ordering system where users can view menu items, place orders, and manage basic order logic.
The focus is on clean code, clarity, and correct program flow.

## Features
- Display available menu items
- Create and manage orders
- Basic input validation
- Simple and readable code structure

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++  
- Tools: Git, GitHub

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ZiadGawad/Food-Ordering-System.git
2. Open the project folder
3. Compile all '.cpp' files together
4. Run the main file from the terminal or your IDE

## What I Learned
- How to break down a real-world problem into logical steps
- Writing cleaner and more organized code
- Using Git and GitHub to track and publish a project

## Notes
This project was developed as a part of my personal learning journey and focuses on fundamentals rather than production-level complexity.
